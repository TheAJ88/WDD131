			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To showcase my writing from a Science Fiction Literature class. I've been meaning to create a portfolio-style website for my writing and have it be more interactive than normal sites. I have learned stuff from my cloud technologies class that would allow me to do so much more but I figured I could get to work on the base with this assignment.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Casual readers and hardcore science fiction fans. These stories are flashes, ergo, they can be called the tiktoks of writing in the sense that they are shorter than your average short story but big enough to pack provocative and entertaining material.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
				I will be using Javascript to add the following elements : Interactive Story Previews, Search Functionality, Theme Toggle (Light/Dark Mode). Should be pretty easy.
			</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/241623-d0cd94-3c787e-c7ef00-d56f3e"

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#D56F3E]</td>

						<td class="accent1">[#3C787E]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#C7EF00]</td>

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
