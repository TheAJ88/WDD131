            <p>
                Hello! I am Akshat Johanan Gutty and this is my website about my writing!
                These flashes were born in a Science Fiction Literature class I had the privilege of taking on campus. 
                These assignments were meant to build up our creative processes to build better stories, and this collection of stories is my personal favorite.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site is the beginning of that archive — a place where each flash can live, breathe, and be discovered. 
                I’ve always wanted to build a home for my writing, and this project finally gave me the push to do it.
            </p>

            <p>
                The stories here are intentionally shorter than your average short-story. They can be called the "tik-toks" of writing, minus the mindless jargon, of course.

            </p>

            <p>
                As the archive grows, I plan to add more interactivity, deeper lore connections, and maybe even 
                branching story paths. For now, this is the foundation — and I’m excited to build on it.
            </p>
