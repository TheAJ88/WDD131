The corporation had gathered, all in their golden gowns adorned with white stars and earthy suits
with sapphire rings. There had been a commotion since the ships had landed and pleasantries had
been exchanged. There were tall and long windows all around the port to gaze out into the distant
dark where stars lay glittering and shining, also probably gathering to see the imprisonment of
their God. The Sun the port had aligned itself behind was no ordinary one. It was special. But not
because it was orange with continents of purple light moving across it, but because it was a
rejuvenator. Even now you could see the occasional blasts of yellow to distant galaxies unknown,
shooting straight for their suns to revive them and provide vitality again. It was a strange sight
indeed, the way space folded right before a blast was released, causing the light of the sun to
bend as if contracting and then releasing as if space itself was.

"A rubber band." I turned to see a man with a perfectly trimmed moustache and a green suit that
seemed to be constantly shifting shades slow enough to not cause annoyance in the other's eyes.

"Sir Cornwell." I acknowledged before turning back to my view. I was lucky enough to have a
first-class view to the setting, which meant that at the snap of a finger, I could have my whole
room turn transparent and view the sun's imprisonment with full immersion as if I were a eternal
being floating endlessly and aimlessly in the cosmos. But unfortunately this gift meant I was also
easy to find.

"Your thoughts are exceptionally readable today Lady Tarim." He said before gesturing to the
seat beside me.

"Do not belittle me Sir Cornwell. Your skill has vastly improved since we last met which is
evidently why you can now gleam even words from my mind." I nodded at his gesture and he sat
down. I turned to face him and asked, "What can you read now?"

"Now now, you do not need to belittle me. You know you're hard to read when caught in guard."
He replied with a chuckle. I smiled and turned back to the sun. The metallic shells were already
closing in on the sun, closing and capturing it in a machine that would now regulate its energy
output and send it to the corporation's harvesters instead, where it would be sold by the output.

"Well then, I suppose it's done." He said beside me in a monotone voice.

"I suppose it is. A shame those protests never amounted to anything." I replied back, twirling one
of the seven rings on my hand.

"Do not tell me you were on the side of the distants Lady Cornwell! It would be a prime shame
to lose your mind to foolish philosophies." He protested my words.

"Hm." I said while still twirling my fingers, looking at the shells now closing in. The
enslavement of this sun would fill my pockets, for sure, but to what end? The previous ventures
of the corporation were harmful no doubt, but energy had always been a separate area no
business had tried to dabble in. It was a moral area, not for the steel-hearted personalities of
businesses to try to invade, and yet I was seeing the enslavement of the sacred sun right in front
of me. I couldn't help but let those feelings I had buried deep down be roused again. They shifted
in their dark graves, eager to grasp the chance of rising to the surface. There would unfortunately
be no such chance, I thought as I sighed and shuffled in my seat, my black dress shifting to fit the
outline of my body. The golden chains moved accordingly and I stared. The signs of royalty.

What separated me from the distants. I felt a slight feeling of disgust as I looked at them despite
how elegant they made me look. It wasn't a sign of beauty. It was a sign of oppression. I looked
at the shells almost fully enclosing the sun now, with only a line of light slowly decreasing in
size.

"Almost as if it closes its eyes for the last time." Sir Cornwell commented. I nodded in
agreement. Then the port shook. I turned around to see what had caused the disturbance. I looked
at Sir Cornwell a second after, and saw his eyes closed and his brow furrowed deep. He opened
his eyes immediately after and had a slightly confused look.

"Something just arrived in our SetSpace." I turned back to the front and saw it. It was a junkship,
nothing even worthy of consideration. I almost thought it was an accidental jump before I
realized that would be too wild of a coincidence. I willed the window to zoom in on the ship a
little and saw a figure in a combat spacesuit climb out on top. He had a silver long rod on his
shoulders, not a weapon, no. It was something else. He stood still, aiming at the shell and fired a
single blast of white light which sped toward the shell and hit it, causing each crevice and
external part of the shell to glow for a second. The shell then slowly collapsed inward and
exploded, the window dimmed the light by default which was why I could see the explosion. The
sun was free. The rod disintegrated into silvery particles as the figure turned around. He
unsheathed a dagger on his chest and pointed it towards the port. It lit up and expanded with red
energy, turning it into a full-fledged blade. The Blade of Shouran. There was only one being in
the Universe who was currently rumored to be in possession of it.

"Illshari." I heard Cornwell say in disgust.

"Srivan." I whispered under my breath. There he stood, in protest of everything the corporation
had stood for. No fear, no remorse, and more importantly, not a shred of nervousness as he
committed this act of defiance.

Cornwell stomped off, talking into his transmitter as I stood up and stared at him. I couldn't help
but finally feel something. A strange experience I thought. I felt giddy with excitement as the
political implications of this action began to reveal themselves in my mind. Life was finally not
monotonous anymore.

He stayed there still pointing the blade at us as the port had raised the alarm and the members
had begun leaving in panicked fashion. I could feel the ships being released and executing the
jumps back to their home-worlds. All this for one man. I chuckled. Only a member of the house
of Illshari could do something so bold and incredibly stupid.

"Arvan's gonna have a hard time living up to you Sri." I said with a smile and tapped at the
bracelet on my wrist. "Prepare my shuttle RIXY." I spoke into it. "Yes, Miss Tarim. Anywhere
specific you would like to go?"

I looked back at Srivan and sighed.

"Somewhere away from political drama please.
