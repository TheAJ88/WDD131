He was thrown back through the straw and mud huts which were luckily empty because of the
evacuation call. He laid there on the ground and coughed up blood which landed back on his
face. The curse of gravity. He got to his feet and checked the capacity on his armor. It read
thirty-seven percent in blue flashing numbers. He wiped his face and looked forward at the
smoke. A human emerged. Only his lower body was clothed properly. His torso was exposed to
the harsh environment of Ouroboros, only it wasn't. There was a dark cape-like cloth on his
body. It glowed green in some parts, in the true fashion of the Ralgae.

"Yo. Silus." The figure called out with a sneer.

"Smythe. These people are not at fault." Silus called out, feeling blood still slide down his
cheek.

"They watched Silus. They watched. They could've have done something. They could've
helped. They could've shown kindness." Smythe looked around at the destroyed town and spat
on the ground.

"No, the only true law is power. And as long as I'm the strongest here, I am the law."

Smythe wasn't wrong. The Ralgae fed off powerful emotions. It couldn't process complex
emotions, so it had to be fed one distinct feeling to actually provide tangible results. And Smythe
was feeding it with hate. Hence the bizarre discharge whenever he unleashed an arcane blast.
There were no complex moves or techniques. Smythe was simply releasing hate in a physical
form, a volatile form of energy and it was devastating enough to wreak havoc and rightfully
place him as the strongest on the battlefield.

"They're using you Smythe. They can't enter the battlefield, so they chose you and fed off your
need to belong." Silus replied, straightening his posture.

"MY NEED TO BELONG ?? DON'T YOU DARE LOOK DOWN ON ME SILUS!" Smythe
yelled.

The cloak shivered a little.

"WHAT ABOUT YOU SILUS? YOUR STUPID ARMOR ONLY FUNCTIONS ON THE
STRENGTH OF THE BELIEF OF PEOPLE AROUND YOU? WHO BELIEVES IN YOU
NOW?"

Silus hated to admit it in his mind, but Smythe was right. The armor's capacity had now dropped
to twenty-nine percent. Using the shivering blade was out of the question now. The people's
belief in him was diminishing. He couldn't win the fight if this kept up.

"WHO BELIEVES IN YOU NOW !!? " Silus was too lost in thought to see that Smythe had
closed the distance between them in less than a second. He first felt the physical force of the
punch to the gut and then the cruel power of the Ralgae kick in, sending him flying in the air and
back down a few feet away. The armor itself would not break, Silus consoled himself. It was an
alloy of eternity steel, the metal of the Tomeseekers after all. But he knew that the moment the
belief in him vanished away, the armor would crumble to dust.

"No matter." He said aloud and charged toward Smythe. His gauntlets charged up
and began vibrating as he directed his fist toward Smythe's face. It landed and pushed Smythe
a few feet back. Smythe opened his mouth, no doubt, to mock him, but could not get anything
out as the second punch landed.

'To the gut.' Silus stated his next move to himself, running the memory of combat training in his
head again. That was the advantage he had over Smythe. He had been trained to decease
combatants in the war while Smythe was fighting out of pure instinct and rage.
"GAUNTLET MAX!" he yelled as he delivered the punch to Smythe's gut. It was a success.
Smythe landed on the ground, raising dust in his fall.

Silus coughed as he stared back at the screen. Thirty percent. It was somewhat alright.

Suddenly, there was a force pushing at him. He managed to process what just happened as he
stared at Smythe. A tentacle had extended from the cloak and tried to stab him in the chest.
Then, when it was unsuccessful, it went up and began to strangle him. He felt it wrap around his
neck. It didn't feel like anything tangible because of how cold and senseless it felt. There was no
external sensation. It was just a visual performance while his throat began constricting by itself.
"I don't belong ... heh." Smythe chuckled through his bleeding nose as he looked up at Silus.
"Maybe the reason you've been hardstuck below fifty capacity is because you don't belong
Silus."

Silus could feel his lungs begin to rebel and scream as they realized they weren't receiving their
due share of oxygen. He wouldn't be able to take this any longer. The helmet had been ripped
from his head earlier in the fight and instead of regenerating it, had decided to save his resources
to contribute to his gauntlets.

"One .... more .... trick." he willed his gauntlet blasters to activate and he let it shoot, hoping it
would cause enough damage to buy him time. The cloak shifted to protect its host and seemed to
recoil in pain. Smythe yelled out and threw him away. He flew over the field and over the
crashed engines.

This time, he felt the damage taken by the armor seep into his body. Stinging pain shot all over
his body in a cruel embrace. He turned over and spit blood down on the ground. A tear ran
down, clearing the dust on his face in a single trail.

"HAVE SOME FAITH !! " he slammed the ground, mentally preparing himself for his second
round with Smythe. He had likely only caused a little pain and not actually dealt any damage. He
looked down at the screen again. It was at twenty-three percent now.

"Uncle Silus?"

"Huh?" he turned to see a little girl under some debris.

"WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?" He yelled at the girl. "Where are your-"

The realization hit Silus. The escape engines had been shot down before they could even exit
the atmosphere. Judging by the looks of it, the girl had had a safety net on her during the time of
attack.

"Are we going to die Uncle Silus?" the girl asked in a tone that wouldn't comprehend the events
that occurred until much later in life. Silus stared at her. This was the girl that wanted to be a
Faithrunner in the information session he had conducted. She knew nothing of what she would
be put through so he had silently taken her back and told her that she should choose another
path. But like any kid her age, she stubbornly refused. "I wanna be a hero like you!" she had
yelled amidst childish tears.

Silus rose to his feet. He didn't bother checking the capacity meter. The stakes had risen.
"No." he said looking forward to where Smythe was on his feet dusting his pants.
"No, we're not."

Smythe didn't even have time to process the hurling Silus. Another punch connected.
Smythe was faster this time. He spun, slightly decreasing the damage the punch had dealt while
also stretching out his arm toward the still-flying Silus. Tentacles shot out of the cloak giving
Smythe a sly smile. Silus clicked something on his hand and punched the little space between
him and the pursuing tentacles. A shockwave was produced, knocking even Smythe back to the
dust. He looked up in surprise. Silus was on a different level than before. An intensity unlike
before, burned in his eyes.

Smythe grinned and braced himself. Silus charged forward, except this time there was no
punch. A glowing blue blade shot out of his right arm and was raised in arc-like motion to cut
down Smythe. The cloak stopped Silus completely wrapping around his armor, restricting his
movements as he stayed there suspended a few feet away.

"This is how it ends Silus."

"Indeed." a defeated look washed over Silus's face. It was a sign of victory. Smythe composed
himself.

"It is a pity no one believed in you. We would have had a very different fight if so."

"You're slightly wrong there." The armor began making a sound that rose in amplitude every
second, as if it were powering up for something.

"What?" Smythe questioned, a little fear crawling up his voice.

"I can't win against you Smythe. Not now at least. But I don't need to win." Silus glanced to his
side and Smythe followed his gaze. A little girl was climbing up the hill.

Smythe's heart dropped. He looked down at Silus's capacity meter.

"We both need to lose."

A violent scream, the likes of which Ouroboros had devoured multiple times was issued from
Smythe's dying throat.

The armor glowed bright for three seconds. In three seconds, the entire battlefield lit up, casting
shadows on the dusty planet. and surprising ships hovering in the outer rim.

After the dust had settled and the other Faithrunners came to assess the damage, they only
found a little girl sobbing on the ground. A section of the battlefield had been scorched with very
little remnants to suggest the outcome of the battle. There was a single piece of Ralgae still
alive which was promptly collected for experiments and a piece of Faithrunner armor. It was an
entire arm. The screen on the arm was still functioning on its last remnants of power and only
had a number on it. It was glitching out but kept its place on the screen.
