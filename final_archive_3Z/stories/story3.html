Caramelized onions and specks of spicy mayonnaise littered the floor as Chuck Malt stared at the
light above him. There was another boom which he defended himself against by setting his hand
above his head as he lay there on the new road. The dust around him spread again as a deep hum
began above. He stared at his food truck which had begun to defy gravity and move upward
slowly toward the light. Chuck felt a sudden weightlessness as he realized he had begun floating
too, in the same position he was in when he had been knocked down by the boom. He had heard
of events like this out in the city at night but never anticipated it would happen to him. He felt a
sense of childish excitement that was quickly killed by the overbearing sense of dread as he
realized he would no longer be able to provide for his brothers as he was taken away. He couldn't
help Milo buy the new books he needed, or Smythe with his lab equipment, or Ben with his
homework anymore. The tears rose up too in accordance with the propulsion toward the light.
Now that he was a little above ground, he could see the circular shape of the vessel with the
light. He closed his eyes and said a silent prayer and then felt another presence take over his
thoughts. He shivered as a terrible cold overtook his body and shut his eyes in response. He felt
gravity shift and landed on a cold surface. He hesitantly opened his eyes and stared at three
humanoid beings, only they weren't so human. They had one eye that went way above their
heads and were at the end of a tentacle-like muscle without the suckers. They were staring at him
with the occasional innocent blinks and that terrified him. They were studying him, no doubt,
and would commit untold atrocities on his body that he considered a temple, albeit an obese
temple. He considered suicide, only there wasn't anything to harm himself with.

"Greetings, Chuck of Malt." An alien finally spoke. He simply stared at the alien as it waited
patiently.

"Oh, er, hello." He finally broke the silence after realizing they needed him to respond.

"You are gravely mistaken in thinking we are going to violate your body." The Alien responded.

"Oh er .. " he felt the blood rush to his cheeks. "I didn't think that."

"We are in your mind Chuck of Malt." All the Aliens spoke in unison.

"It's just Chuck." He chuckled nervously.

"We bring you here for one purpose Chuck of Malt." The Alien continued. "One glorious
purpose that we sure the Universe chose you for."

The fear turned to a positive excitement. This was a development, Chuck thought to himself as
he involuntarily spaced out and ignored everything the Alien was presently saying. Surely, if he
had some great purpose, the Aliens would want him alive. Maybe he was to be the leader of a
revolution or some great War in a distant galaxy. Perhaps he could even persuade them to take
his brothers with him as a deal-breaker and they would never need to worry about anything ever
again-

"And in all the galaxies, we've never quite encountered burgers as tasty as yours."

"Oh- HUH?" he stopped as his mind processed the Alien's words.

"We desire your burgers, Chuck of Malt. And we will pay handsomely. In that shiny yellow
substance, you humans call Gold." The Alien said and his companions nodded in comedic
unison.

Chuck scratched his head. "I- er, that's all you want?"

"Affirmative."

Chuck chuckled. Gone were the glorious dreams, replaced by the taste of spicy mayonnaise and
cheddar cheese. He would later retell the story countless times in his new mansion with his
brothers and their families. The Gold didn't simply solve their debt problem, it elevated them to
the status of luxury.

But Chuck never forgot where he came from. He was still the only person in his city to still hire
real humans to make his burgers at his restaurant. The machines lacked the love and chaos of a
human, he thought.

The Aliens would, of course, still drop by secretly and Chuck was happy to help them. After
they had their meal, they would fly back to their home world and spread the story there.

The story of Chuck Malt, and the greatest burgers in the Universe.
